### Astrometry
A branch of astronomy that determines the position of celestial bodies on the celestial sphere by measuring angles.

### Atmospheric diffusion or turbulence (known as seeing):
The effect of light scattering produced by the brightest stars.
__See Figure 1 - (a) M45 detail__

### Nebula:
A cluster of interstellar gas and dust.

### Star reduction:
Reducing the apparent diameter of stars in order to extract them from a nebula. __See Figure 1 - (b) Sadr (γ Cygni)__

### Point source:
Light emitted in all directions (as in the case of a star).

### PSF (Point Spread Function):
The spread of a star's image captured by an optical instrument, caused by the diffraction of light.
